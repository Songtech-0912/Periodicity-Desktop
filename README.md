# Periodicity Desktop

## Fork of [Periodicity](https://github.com/kadinzhang/Periodicity)

Periodicity is a dynamic, data-driven Periodic Table built with Vue.js that uses D3 animations and graphs to demonstrate the beauty of periodic trends. 

This is a standalone desktop app that renders Periodicity in a native environment using [DeskGap](https://github.com/patr0nus/DeskGap). It comes with a handy sidebar for a fully desktop feel.
